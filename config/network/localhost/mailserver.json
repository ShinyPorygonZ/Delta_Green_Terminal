I have a little more work to do, and I should double check my calculations, but I think I've Cracked the Laqeuous Equation!!! :3  I'm a little excited at the moment, I'm sending this message mere minutes after crunching the last few digits, but I'm near certain i've got it right. The correct sequence appears to be  9 9 2 0 .2 2 9 9 8 9 2 1 2 .3 3 3.  I'll keep you all posted! I'm going to work out some applications and calculate the claudan transformations ASAP.  Cheers,  Michael"
